1. Development Guide

    If you want to cross compile the source in Linux PC machine, follow these steps, otherwise skip this section.

    1. Refer to the `K260 SOM Starter Kit Tutorial` to build the cross-compilation SDK, and install it to the path you choose or default. Suppose it's SDKPATH.

    2. Run "./build.sh ${SDKPATH}" in the source code folder of current application, to build the application.

    3. The build process in [1.2] will produce a rpm package DefectDetect-2.0.1-1.aarch64.rpm under build/, upload to the board, and run "rpm -ivh --force ./DefectDetect-2.0.1-1.aarch64.rpm" to install updates.


2. Setting up the Board

    1. Get the SD Card Image from (http://xilinx.com/) and follow the instructions in UG1089 to burn the SD card. And install the SD card to J11.

    2. Hardware Setup:

        * Monitor:

          This application requires **4K** monitor, so that up to 3 channels of 1280x800 video could be displayed.

          Before booting the board, please connect the monitor to the board via either DP or HDMI port.

        * UART/JTAG interface:

          For interacting and seeing boot-time information, connect a USB debugger to the J4.

        * Network connection:

          Connect the Ethernet cable to your local network with DHCP enabled to install packages and run Jupyter Notebooks

    3. Power on the board, login with username `petalinux`, and you need to setup the password for the first time bootup.

    4.  Get the latest application package.

        1.  Get the list of available packages in the feed.

            `sudo xmutil      getpkgs`

        2.  Install the package with dnf install:

            `sudo dnf install packagegroup-kv260-defect-detect.noarch`

          Note: For setups without access to the internet, it is possible to download and use the packages locally. Please refer to the `K260 SOM Starter Kit Tutorial` for instructions.

    5.  Dynamically load the application package.

        The firmware consist of bitstream, device tree overlay (dtbo) and xclbin file. The firmware is loaded dynamically on user request once Linux is fully booted. The xmutil utility can be used for that purpose.

        1. Shows the list and status of available acceleration platforms and Applications:

            `sudo xmutil      listapps`

        2.  Switch to a different platform for different Application:

            *  When xmutil listapps reveals that no accelerator is currently active, select the desired application:

                `sudo xmutil      loadapp kv260-defect-detect`

            *  When xmutil listapps reveals that an accellerator is already active, unload it first, then select the desired application:

                `sudo xmutil      unloadapp <NAME_OF_ACTIVE_APP>`

                `sudo xmutil      loadapp kv260-defect-detect`



3. How to run application:

    1. Interacting with the application
    The application is targeted to run only MIPI and file based inputs.

    We assume input to support resolution=1280x800(width=1280 and height=800) format=GRAY8(Y8)

        There are two ways to interact with application, via Jyputer notebook or Command line

        1. Juypter notebook

           Defect-detection Jupyter notebook application must be started with root privilege. 
           So, to stop the running jupyter notebook, which was started by petalinux user. 
           Run below commands as a petalinux user,

               A) Get the list of running Jupyter servers, with the following command:
                   > jupyter-server list

               B) Stop the default Jupyter notebook using the following command:
                   > jupyter-server stop 8888

           Run the python script to install jupyter notebook at specified path as a root user.
           * Example:
               > python3 defect-detect-install.py -d /home/petalinux/notebooks

           Launch the Jupyter notebook with root privilege using the following command:
               > sudo jupyter lab --allow-root --notebook-dir=/home/petalinux/notebooks/defect-detect --ip=<ip address> &

            Use a web-browser (e.g. Chrome, Firefox) to interact with the platform.

            The Jupyter notebook URL can be found with command:

            > sudo jupyter notebook list

            Output example:

            > Currently running servers:
            >
            > `http://ip:port/?token=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

        2. Command Line

            **Note** The application needs to be run with ***sudo*** .

            * Examples:
            **Note** Only one instance of the application can run at a time.

            /* for File-In and File-Out playback, run below command.
            sudo defect-detect -i input.y8 -x raw.y8 -y pre_pros.y8 -z final.y8
            **Note** All 3 stage output will be dumped into file. It's must to give option for all 3 output file name.

            /* for File-In and Display-Out playback, run below command.
            sudo defect-detect -i input.y8
            **Note** All 3 stage outputs will be displayed on DP/HDMI. Input file path needs to be changed as per the requirement.

            /* for Live-In and File-Out playback, run below command.
            sudo defect-detect -x raw.y8 -y pre_pros.y8 -z final.y8
            **Note** All 3 stage output will be dumped into file. It's must to give option for all 3 output file name.

            /* for Live-In and Display-Out playback, run below command.
            sudo defect-detect
            **Note** All 3 stage outputs will be displayed on DP/HDMI.

        1. Command Option:
